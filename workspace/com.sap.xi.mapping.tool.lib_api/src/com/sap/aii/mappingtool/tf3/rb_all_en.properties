CANNOT_PRODUCE_ELEMENT=Cannot produce target element {0}. Queue does not have enough values in context. Target XSD requires a value for this element, but target-field mapping does not produce one. XML instance is probably not valid for source XSD, or target-field mapping does not fulfil requirements of target XSD.
